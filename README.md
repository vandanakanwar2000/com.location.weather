Weather App

The following list of functional requirements is prioritized. Implement as many of these points as you can, given the time you have. Do only as much as your time allows. We favor “quality over quantity”.
 
1) Search by city name or zip code
Implement a search to allow the user to enter a city name or zip code. The result of the search is to display the current weather information for the searched location.
 
2.                   Search by GPS
On the same search screen, also allow user to use GPS location instead to get current weather information.
 
3.                   Most recent search location loads automatically
When you come back to the app after closing it, the weather for the most recent search is displayed.
 
4.                   Recent Searches
Implement a screen that lists recently searched locations. You can tap on a recent search location and see the current weather location.
 
5.                   Delete recent searches
Provide the ability to delete one or more recently searched locations.
